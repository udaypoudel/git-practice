  git merge branchname
=>used to merge the branch .

          important ex. 
         
. from a source branch two branch are made,

. and in both branches changes are made,

. if trying merging branch1 simple merging happens,

. but to merge branch2 git makes another commit object bcoz
  the head of source branch is changed beacuse we already merge  
  the branch1 and now head is pointing to the commit of branch1.



            working on a same file form different branch 
. merge conflict happens
